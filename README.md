### Hey there! I'm Toya Okey-Nwamara

I'm a Computer Science and Cybersecurity student passionate about building impactful tools, exploring tech through a consulting lens, and helping others grow.

I love working on:
- 🔐 Cybersecurity + ethical hacking projects
- 🧠 Data structures and algorithms (currently reading Cracking the Technical Interview)
- 🧰 Teaching tools that make education more efficient 
- 🧩 Projects that blend tech + strategy — think resume screeners, OSINT tools, or consulting dashboards

📚 I'm currently:
- A Lead Instructional Assistant teaching Object-Oriented Programming to several hundred students 
- Interning this summer, where I'm diving deeper into consulting & security
- Preparing for full-time roles with a focus on tech consulting, security, or product strategy
- Grinding certifications 💪

⚡ I believe in learning by doing, and I'm always building, experimenting, and sharing

Please don't hesitate to contact me to collaborate on any project.
